    "Desc": "FlightTicket is a serverless application benchmark running on top of OpenWhisk on Kubernetes. The application is architectured based on the AirplaneTicket benchmark. Different from AirplaneTicket, FlightTicket is implemented in Python and runs as a serverless application on OpenWhisk. One key feature of FlightTicket is that, instead of using a synthetic input generator, FlightTicket uses the US-airlines dataset from the US Department of transport.",
